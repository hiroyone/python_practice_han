        - Python, Ruby (General Purpose, Prototype, OS, A.I. Web Scraping, Education)
        - Go Language (Compact and Fast, good for web services)
        - PhP (for web service)
    - Mobile
        - Kotlin (Android)
        - Swift (iOS)
    - Terminal (Mac), Commmand Prompt (Windows)
        - Bash (Mac)

- Install: Official or Anaconda (Distribution Package)

- Editor
    - VS code <- recommended
    - Jupyter Notebook <- Best for data science or A.I.

- Execution
    - Command Line (Execute file)
    - interactive shell (inc. Jupyter Notebook)

- Python features
    - Python 2.0 series and 3.0 series (3.0 is strongly recommended)
    - interpreted langauge (program is read each time) <-> compiled language
    - interactive language (immediate feedback for each statement => for better debugging)
    - dynamically typed language (no declaration, type can be changed in the middle) <-> Static Language (Java, C)
    - Indentation
    - Pythonic (Undestandable writing style, Zen princples) => Pythonista
